# Web Development

This course is part of the [Computer Science program](https://www.carleton.edu/summer/pre-college/programs/cs/) of the Summer Liberal Arts Institute at Carleton College.

## 4-day session

The goal of the 4-day session is to develop and deploy a web application using *Flask*, *Jinja*, and *MVP.css* in order to present data on the web.

### Tentative schedule

1. Data handling: CSV, Flask
    - Data from a CSV file displayed on the web
2. UI design: HTML, CSS, and Jinja
    - Templates used to present data
3. Interactivity: forms and methods
    - HTML forms used to access data
4. Deployment: Python hosting
    - Final version of the application is deployed

## 3-week session

During the guided research part of the course students are exposed to a variety of tools and frameworks as they build a web application backed by a database.

## Tools and frameworks used

- *Flask*: the back-end logic
- *Jinja*: templates
- *Bulma* or another framework: consistent user interface
- *SQLite3*: permanent data storage
- *Playwright* and *pytest*: testing
- *PythonAnywhere* or *render*: hosting
- *JavaScript*: interactivity
- *Git*: version control

### Projects

Final project is open-ended, but students are expected to build an application with a consistent user interface, persistent data storage, and custom logic.
